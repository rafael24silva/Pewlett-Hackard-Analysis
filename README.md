# Using SQL for Pewlett Hackard
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help the company for the upcoming "silver tsunami". By preparing several different tables with different information, we are able to discern how many employees will be retiring and which ones are eligible for the new mentorship program.
## Results
From the many tables that we have created, we can see that:

* The bulk of the people that are eligible for retirement are senior engineers, and senior staff.
* There are only 1,549 retiring employees that are eligible for mentorship.
* There will be a big disparity betweeen mentors and new recruits, we can also see that the focus of the company should be to hire many senior engineers and senior staff.

* The two tables above demonstrate the disparity between the retirement eligible employees by position (left) and the mentorship eligible employees by position (right). To address this disparity, it is important for the company to create an efficient program that would group mentors and new recruits accordingly.

## Summary
The number of roles needing to be filled as the "silver tsunami" is underway will depend on the year. The first ones to retire will be those born in 1952. The best way to determine this is by creating a table that numbers and groups the retirement eligible employees by their birth year. After this is done, we can determine the number of roles that need filling for each of the next four years.

After seeing the table that was posted above, we can see that there will not be enough mentors for the big amount of new roles that are needed. The only way we can possibly make this work is by determining how many mentees one mentor can take and move on from there. We can also establish that the bulk of mentors that are needed will need to be qualified for training senior engineers and senior staff.
